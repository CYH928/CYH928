## Welcome to YKHN C.'s[^1] GitHub
I am a hardworking, studious, proactive, and polite person currently studying at the HKIIT at IVE(LWL)'s Higher Diploma in Cloud and Data Centre Administration, majoring in AWS, Linux, SQL, etc. I often use my team leadership skills to lead our team, and I have also learned how to communicate with others. I have actively participated in different competitions and activities, and have won awards. In the future, I would like to obtain more certifications in the industry so that I can learn more different skills.
